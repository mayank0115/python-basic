        "\n",
        "-Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability and allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to many other languages.\n",
        "Why Python is Popular:\n",
        "Easy to Learn and Use:\n",
        "Wide Range of Applications:\n",
        "Large Standard Library:\n",
        "Strong Community Support:\n",
        "Cross-Platform Compatibility:\n",
        "Python's simplicity allows for faster development and iteration, which is critical in startups and prototyping.\n",

        "2.what is an interpreter in python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-In Python, an interpreter is the program that reads and executes Python code line by line\n",
        "\n",
        "3.what are pre defined key words in python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-In Python, predefined keywords (also called reserved words) are special words that are part of the language syntax. These keywords have fixed meanings and purposes, and you cannot use them as identifiers (like variable names, function names, etc.)\n",
        "\n",
        "4.can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "-No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python because Keywords are reserved by the Python language because they define the syntax and structure of the code (like if, for, class, etc.). Using them as variable names would confuse the interpreter.\n",
